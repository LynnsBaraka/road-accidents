    "### Problem statement\n",
    "Our primary objective is to uncover hidden patterns and risk factors contributing to road accidents beyond commonly recognized factors like speeding and impaired driving. By identifying these additional risk elements, we aim to enhance road safety strategies, improve accident prevention measures, and reduce the severity of road accidents.\n",
    "### Why this Topic\n",
    "Road accidents are a major concern worldwide, causing injuries and deaths that have a profound impact on families and communities. In Kenya, road accidents remain a significant public health issue, with thousands of people losing their lives each year due to road-related incidents. Our dataset is Not specific to Kenya.  According to the World Health Organization (WHO), road traffic injuries are among the top 10 leading causes of death worldwiede, highlighting the urgent need for effective prevention strategies. By studying the reasons behind these accidents and identifying hidden patterns and risk factors, we can develop targeted interventions to improve road safety and reduce the number of accidents, injuries, and fatalities on roads worldwide.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Domain\n",
    "This project applies to the transportation and public safety domain, with potential implications for government agencies, transportation companies, and advocacy groups.\n",
    "### Target Audience\n",
    "Government policymakers, transportation experts, safety agencies, and the general public will benefit from insights and recommendations generated by this analysis.\n",
    "### Real-World Impact\n",
    "Implementation of findings could lead to a reduction in road accidents, injuries, fatalities, and associated economic costs on a global scale.\n",
    "### Pre-existing Projects\n",
    "Our project aims to uncover additional hidden factors and patterns using advanced data analysis techniques, complementing existing research on road accident causes and prevention strategies."

    "1. To identify Key Predictive Factors: Investigate the influence of various roadway and environmental factors (e.g., road surface, lighting conditions, weather) on crash occurrence and severity to identify key predictive attributes.\n",
    "2. To assess Driver Behavior Impact: Analyze the correlation between driver behavior attributes (e.g., speed, alcohol/drug involvement) and crash severity to understand the role of driver actions in accidents.\n",
    "3. To develop Early Warning Systems: Create predictive models to anticipate high-risk areas and times for accidents, enabling proactive measures such as enhanced law enforcement or targeted road safety campaigns.\n",
    "4. To evaluate Infrastructure Vulnerability: Assess the impact of road infrastructure features (e.g., intersections, road markings) on crash frequency and severity to prioritize infrastructure improvements for accident prevention.\n",
    "5. To optimize Resource Allocation: Utilize predictive analytics to optimize resource allocation for emergency response and medical services by forecasting the likelihood and severity of future accidents in specific regions or road segments."
